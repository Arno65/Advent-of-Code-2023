# Advent-of-Code-2023

This repository contains most of my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) 2023.\
My main programming language is Haskell. I'll also do some work in Clojure.

For collecting the stars I will first code the solution in the language that works best for me. 
Most of the time that will be Haskell.

Spoiler alert: All code has the final results of the tasks in the comment section at the beginning of the code.\
Also note that these final results are obtained with the puzzle input from my Advent-of-Code-2023 account.

Day 1 and 2 have solutions in Haskell and Clojure.

Day 3, 4 and 5 have solutions in Haskell.

Day 6 has solutions in Haskell and Clojure.

Day 7 and 8 have solution in Haskell. \
I tried a Clojure solution for day 8 but a 'Stack overflow' and lack of knowledge prevents me writing a working version.

Day 9 has solutions in Haskell and Clojure.

Day 10 and 11 have solutions in Haskell. \
I'm NOT happy with the code for day 10. It's way too much and part 2 still has a slow sloution. But it works.

Due to too much other work, I didn't have time to do some clean coding on days 12 and 13.

Day 14 has solutions in Haskell and Clojure.

Day 15 and 16 have solutions in Haskell. \

Day 21 has solutions in Haskell and Swift. \
Running the compiled Haskell version of day 21 will take many hours! \
The Swift version will do the job in a few seconds.

W.i.p.:\
Both parts 2 of day 5 and 10 have very slow solutions. (There are more efficient solutions.)\
Clean up code for days 12 and 13.
Will work on more Clojure solutions in the near future.

Happy coding!
